# check_snmp_patchlevel.cfg is the configuration file for the Nagios #
# Nagios plugin check_snmp_patchlevel.pl. It is best placed into     #
# <nagios>/libexec or etc/objects. This file white- and blacklists   #
# version strings returned by SNMP sysDescr content. This content is #
# not standardized, so we can use it only with vendors who provide a #
# correct, parsable OS version string. Currently, valid OS types are #
# 'ios', 'asa' and 'pix' for Cisco.                                  #
#                                                                    #
# This file needs to be readable for nagios, i.e. the nagios user.   #
#                                                                    #

#                                                                    #
# Column 1: string 'approved', 'obsolete', 'med-vuln' or 'cri-vuln'  #
#                                                                    #
# Versions marked 'approved' will return 'OK' (green) in Nagios.     #
# 'approved' is meant for versions that are confirmed to be recent,  #
# without known vulnerabilities (yet) or otherwise desired by IT     #
# networks/management, i.e. for standardization.                     #
#                                                                    #
# Versions marked 'obsolete' will return 'WARNING' (yellow). This is #
# is meant for versions that are EOL, but not confirmed vulnerable   #
# yet. It is highly undesired to run these versions.                 #
#                                                                    #
# Versions marked 'med-vuln' will return 'WARNING' (yellow). This is #
# is meant for versions that are confirmed to have vulnerabilities   #
# who are either currently not applicable, or rated low to medium    #
# with compensations (i.e. ACL's) in place. We desire to upgrade     #
# these versions in a planned fashion.                               #
#                                                                    #
# Versions marked 'crit-vuln' will return 'CRITICAL' (red). This is  #
# is meant for versions that are confirmed to be vulnerable with a   #
# high risk off immediate impact such as device down or compromised. #
# These versions should be upgraded as soon as possible.             #
#                                                                    #
# Versions that are neither 'approved', 'obsolete' or 'vulnerable'   #
# will return 'UNKNOWN' (orange) in Nagios. This is meant as a note  #
# to check if this version is OK to run, so it can be categorized.   #
#                                                                    #
# Column 2: OS type string, must match check_snmp_patchlevel.pl -g   #
#                                                                    #
# This is the OS type suppported by check_snmp_patchlevel.pl. It is  #
# used to match up the SNMP returned version string to the string    #
# provided here. Currently supported versions are ios for Cisco IOS  #
# and ASA for Cisco security appliances.                             #
#                                                                    #
# Column 3: OS Version string, must match the SNMP returned value    #
#                                                                    #
# This version string must be the exact string as returned by the    #
# check_snmp_patchlevel.pl parsed output. The output can be verified #
# by running check_snmp_patchlevel.pl without the -f <file> option.  #
# Right now, there is no way to use a wildcard, i.e. to mark all     #
# versions 12.1.* as critical, so all version variants must have a   #
# separate entry.                                                    #
#                                                                    #
# Column 4: remarks string, i.e. reason for marked 'obsolete'        #
# This column may be left empty.                                     #
#                                                                    #
